# TrendPress

TrendPress is a WordPress framework. There’s a parent theme (TrendPress) that contains a lot of useful scripts and settings, ensuring a solid workflow and quick development of your WordPress theme. Then there’s a child theme (TrendPress Child) with minimal styling. Use this theme to develop your bespoke WordPress theme.
